      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">AML Policy</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy of <strong>CoinRise</strong>{" "}
        ("the Company") establishes our commitment to prohibit and actively
        prevent money laundering and any activity that facilitates money
        laundering or the financing of terrorism or other criminal acts. All
        officers, employees, and affiliates of the Company must adhere strictly
        to this policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
        1. Understanding Money Laundering
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Money laundering typically occurs in three stages:
        <br />
        <strong>Placement</strong>: Illegally obtained funds are introduced into
        the financial system through deposits or monetary instruments.
        <br />
        <strong>Layering</strong>: The funds are moved across various accounts
        or institutions to obscure their origin.
        <br />
        <strong>Integration</strong>: The laundered funds are reintroduced into
        the economy and may be used to purchase assets or fund businesses.
        <br />
        Terrorist financing may not involve proceeds of crime but rather
        attempts to disguise the origin or intended use of legitimate or illicit
        funds for illegal purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Client Responsibility</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Clients must guarantee the legal origin, ownership, and authorization to
        use any funds transferred to their CoinRise account.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Definition</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For the purpose of this policy, money laundering includes any attempt to
        conceal or disguise the origin of criminal proceeds to make them appear
        legitimate.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
        4. Employee Responsibilities
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All employees whose roles relate to CoinRiseâ€™s services must be familiar
        with and adhere to AML regulations relevant to their job duties.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Compliance Program</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        CoinRise maintains a company-wide AML program to ensure compliance with
        applicable laws. This program coordinates regulatory requirements across
        business units and legal entities to minimize exposure to AML and
        terrorist financing risks.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Training and Awareness</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        - All new hires receive AML training during onboarding.
        <br />
        - Employees involved in AML or KYC operations must complete annual
        training.
        <br />- Targeted training sessions are also conducted for employees with
        specific responsibilities.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Record Keeping</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Identification documents and service records must be retained for the
        minimum duration required by applicable local laws.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Affiliate Compliance</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
